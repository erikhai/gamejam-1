  <h2>Mission Briefing</h2>
  <p>You awaken to flickering lights, a shrill alarm, and blood in your helmet. Your ship has collided with an asteroid. Hull integrity is compromised. Oxygen is dropping fast.</p>
  <p>You have <strong>180 seconds</strong> before life support fails.</p>
  <p>The escape hatch is locked behind a 4-digit code â€” one that is set for emergencies. But the impact scrambled your memory. The only thing you remember was that this ship was going on a journey to find life on another planet.</p>
  <p>Fortunately, you left clues hidden across key systems of the ship but you cannot remember why. Three fragments of the code.</p>
  <p>Recover them. Escape. Or be forever lost in the void.</p>
